SWOT Analysis

Strengths
    -Very few or no sites are doing this.
    -There is a niche market for this site.
    -The internet is way of planning events, but camping is only shared in the past tense.
    -This could attract a younger crowd to the outdoors.
    -Could be a positive alternative to planning events with your friends or getting to know people you dont know.
    -Could be an application used by on of the big box stores (rei, cabelas, sports autority, academy, etc.)

Weaknesses
    -very niche market.
    -One of the reasons people do go camping is to get away from technology and reconnect with nature. Could create a conflict. 
    -The app only applies to Texas. Leaves out many popular areas in the U.S. and gloabally.
    -Could be crushed by a larger competitor that was able to do an app with larger base.

Opportunities
    -Could be more useful and useable to the user to have a site that is devoted to small and large trips. 
    -Has the opportunity for a large and devoted following if the app is actually good.
    -App could eventually expand nationwide and possibly global.


Threats
    -REI does have a site that lets you jump onto their planned "Big Trips".
    -With an app this small, if it doesnt work flawlessly it would be trashed pretty quickly.
