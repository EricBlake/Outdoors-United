<p>I think this site has a very nice color palette. It gives the feeling of being outside which is what I am going for. I think the colors may be a bit too bright for what I am going for, but they are a in the direction I want to go.</p>

<p>I like this site because it has a fairly open layout. The Blogs Page has a simple layout. The very large header and footer go well with the minimal content. I do not like when the site is scaled to mobile, the menu is hamburgered in the middle of the nav bar. Also I like how the images are larger on the individual events page, but the are a bit blury so they are not scaling well.</p>

<p>This is an interesting site. First, it is obviously a site dedicated to the outdoors, and more specifically hunting, but it does not scream cammo or cabelas as you often times see. The design is responsive with a mobile, tablet and desktop version. The layout looks very modern. Almost like something IBM would put out if it were building an outdoors website. The call to action items are visible and apparent. This may be a good basis for a layout on the dashboard. The cons. This is not a very inclusive site. You have to create an account and then get approved to enter from the site administrator. Seems a little strange in 2016. Overall it appears to be a well built site.</p>
